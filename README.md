# fMRwhy - Facilitating fMRI analysis with SPM12 and Matlab

(CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT - a culmination of scripts and functions from
[here](https://github.com/jsheunis/matlab-spm-scripts-jsh),

## What is `fMRwhy`?

This is a Matlab- and SPM12-based toolbox with many helper functions to assist in your fMRI analysis journey.
With `fMRwhy` you are shown *how* to calculate interesting quality metrics, *how* to visualize outcomes,
*how* to analyse your data with batch scripts, and *how* to build a BIDS compatible analysis pipeline,
all to flexible levels of automation. 

But, first, have you stopped and asked *why* you're doing what you're doing? Like, really, *why*?
It is certainly a very important question to try and answer, ideally before you start looking for patterns in your data.
`fMRwhy` can not help you with that directly, but it has some neat scripts and functions to facilitate an exploratory approach.

## Functionality

- (*This section will be updated with more detail in future*)

## Current status

This toolbox is still being developed. The aim is to have a stable release by the end of May 2020.

## Contributing

You are welcome to fork the (currently very messy) repository and send a
[pull request](https://github.com/jsheunis/fMRwhy/pulls) if you are interested.
Otherwise, I'm open to receiving [issues](https://github.com/jsheunis/fMRwhy/issues)
if you have questions, comments or feedback. (*This section will be updated with more detail in future*)

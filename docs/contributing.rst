Contributing to ``fMRwhy``
==========================

The ultimate goal is for ``fMRwhy`` to be used and maintained by a community of fMRI researchers,
such that its functionality can grow based on the needs of researchers working directly with fMRI data and methods.

Contributions to ``fMRwhy`` are therefore very welcome and encouraged!

function [GM_img_bin, WM_img_bin, CSF_img_bin, brain_img_bin] = fmrwhy_util_createBinaryMasks(gm_fn, wm_fn, csf_fn, threshold)

% DESCRIPTION:
% This function constructs 3D binary masks for GM, WM and CSF based on the
% relative value of GM/WM/CSF tissue probability maps per voxel. It assumes
% that the image filename parameters are for images that are in the same
% space (i.e. they match in size, voxel by voxel). If a threshold is
% specified (0<= threshold <=1), the images are first thresholded before
% the binary masks are calculated. For no threshold, specify zero.
%
% INPUT:
% gm_fn         - filename of pre-real-time functional scan
% wm_fn         - filename of T1-weighted structural scan
% csf_fn        - filename of T1-weighted structural scan
% threshold     -
%
% OUTPUT:
% GM_img_bin        - structure with filenames and data
% WM_img_bin        - structure with filenames and data
% CSF_img_bin        - structure with filenames and data
% brain_img_bin        - structure with filenames and data
